# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.7.0]

### Added
- **`ComputedPipe`**: Reactive derived state that auto-updates when dependencies change
- **`AsyncPipe`**: Handle async operations with built-in loading/data/error states
- **`AsyncValue`**: Sealed class for representing async states (`AsyncLoading`, `AsyncData`, `AsyncError`, `AsyncRefreshing`)
- Hub helpers: `computedPipe()` and `asyncPipe()` methods for easy creation
- Comprehensive unit tests for all new features

## [1.6.0]

### Performance
- Much faster notification path
  - Switched subscriber list from List<ReactiveSubscriber> to List<Element> for direct access.
  - Casting now happens only during attach/detach, not during every update.
  - Cut out extra bounds checks and mounted checks inside the loop.
  - Try-catch is now only around user listener callbacks.
  - Overall, rebuilds are faster because the hot path has far less overhead.

## [1.5.0]

### Performance
- Optimized Pipe internals for improved performance
  - Changed subscriber storage from Set to List
  - Removed defensive copying in notification loop
  - Inlined hot path methods with `@pragma('vm:prefer-inline')`
  - Added `identical()` check before equality comparison
- Added safety checks for concurrent modifications and disposal during notifications

## [1.4.4]

  - Documetation updates and Badges updates

## [1.4.3]

  - Documetation updates on nested sinks and in Async Example 11

## [1.4.2]

  - Added Permanent discord invite badge
 
## [1.4.1]

  - Badges updates 


## [1.4.0+1]

  - Analytics Changes and Readme Updates 


## [1.4.0]

### Added
- **`HubListener` Widget**: New widget for executing conditional side effects based on Hub state changes without rebuilding its child. Perfect for navigation, dialogs, and other side effects.
  - Type-safe with mandatory generic type parameter enforcement
  - `listenWhen` condition to control when the callback fires
  - `onConditionMet` callback for side effects
  - Automatic lifecycle management
- **Hub-level Listeners**: New `Hub.addListener()` method that triggers on any pipe update within the hub
  - Returns a dispose function for easy cleanup
  - Attaches to all existing and future pipes automatically
  - Memory-safe with proper listener management
- **Comprehensive Async Operations Example**: Added detailed example demonstrating real-world async data loading patterns
  - User profile with 10+ fields
  - Full-screen loading overlay using Stack and Sink
  - Separate reactive fields (gender, age) with independent Sinks
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Demonstrates granular reactivity benefits

### Enhanced
- **Disposed State Safety**: Added runtime checks to prevent usage of disposed objects
  - `Pipe` methods now throw clear errors when used after disposal (value getter/setter, addListener, removeListener, pump)
  - `Sink` and `Well` constructors now assert that pipes are not disposed
  - `Hub.registerPipe()` asserts pipe is not disposed
  - Better error messages guiding developers to fix issues
- **Protected API Surface**: Added `@protected` annotations to internal methods across all core components
  - `Hub.registerPipe()`, `Hub.pipe()`, `Hub.checkNotDisposed()`, `Hub.onDispose()`
  - `Pipe.attach()`, `Pipe.detach()` (used internally by Sink/Well)
  - Clearer distinction between public and internal APIs
- **Code Quality**: Improved internal consistency
  - `Hub.pipe()` now uses `Hub.registerPipe()` internally (DRY principle)
  - Graceful cleanup when detaching from disposed pipes
  - Consistent naming with `addListener()` throughout

### Changed
- **Non-const Constructors**: `Sink`, `Well`, and `MultiHubProvider` constructors are no longer const to support runtime assertions
  - Enables better developer experience with clear error messages
  - Minimal impact on performance, significant gain in safety

### Documentation
- Completely updated README with new package features
- All examples now follow best practice pattern: `final hub = context.read<MyHub>()` at the top of build methods
- Updated examples to show Hub scoping to screens instead of entire app (better lifecycle management)
- Enhanced migration guides from setState, Provider, and BLoC
- Expanded best practices section with new patterns
- Added HubListener usage examples and patterns

## [1.3.0]
- Added `HubProvider.value` to support externally-managed Hub lifecycles. Now you can pass pre-created Hub objects, allowing for global shared state, easier testing, or integration with DI systems. Hubs provided this way are **not** automatically disposed.
- Added `MultiHubProvider` support for mixing existing hub instances (values) and hub factories, providing maximum flexibility for composition and dependency injection use-cases.
- Examples and documentation updated to cover both features.
- Added `state_benchmark` project with 3 tests benchmarking PipeX against Riverpod and BLoC. 
- PipeX achieved best median update time in Basic and Complex tests; Riverpod slightly led in Multi-state. All frameworks performed highly, with PipeX and Riverpod having the most test wins.
